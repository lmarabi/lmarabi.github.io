ABSTRACT

Traffic congestion or crowds gather in a specific place, as in Hajj motivated Scientists and power agencies to investigate and analyze the movements of organisms.
Collecting a real dataset is a hard task as it takes a significant amount of time and effort.
Unfortunately, the cost of acquiring such datasets is very high. For example: the GeoLife, project lead by Microsoft Research spent three years to get the track movement from 182 users.
Our system Crowd Movement Management (CMM) will make virtual crowds on Ascii maps .
Our system CMM will aim to simulate virtual crowds by taking the user specified regionan either Al-Haram in Makka or Al-Haram in Al-Madina or just Al-kabaa region and generate crowd data in one of thiss region.
And also CMM site provide to user to make visolization in openstreetmap on Al-Haram in Makka region .
our system will provide an easy-to-use web interface to user to generate the crowd datasets according to controller-bar (to change number of crowd) that user will choose it, anyone will be able to use the system, for example: researchers and authorities responsible for crowd control, organizations and associations.
The program consists of two main components:
1. The crowd movement grentor in three diffrente specified regionan either Al-Haram in Makka or Al-Haram in Al-Madina or just Al-kabaa region.
2. visulazation with OSM .
Therefore, researchers and field experts will not need to spend their time to generating this crowd by a complicated tools to the normal user Instead, they will focus on their main research.
Keywords: crowd movement, virtual simulation, data, generation, development.
